During the execution of `querier.c` there is an error because you are unable to access the counters in the struct.

We assume that the longest word possible is the number of characters in the query itself. 
We assume there are at most 100 words in a query 

* The querier prints normalized words in the query back to user
* The querier design also supports 'and' precedence over 'or'.
